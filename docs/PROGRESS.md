# ORCA / SAMUDRA Operational Progress

> Single operational status board. Strictly factual. No diary narrative.

## Current Release & Workstream State
- Current version: `v0.1.0-p0-data-foundation`
- Active branch: `main`
- Current milestone: **P0 Marine Data & API Integration Foundation**
- Completion status: **COMPLETE & OFFLINE VERIFIED**

### P0-7 — Authority chat sector context
- Authority chat now sends the active canonical sector `public_id` per request.
- The chat API validates the sector and derives canonical harbor and coordinates before graph execution.
- Explicit Authority context takes precedence over remembered conversation context; history remains retained and prior-sector responses are not shown as the current sector's active response.

### P0-8A — Authority sector hazards on map
- Canonical active hazard applicability is resolved by sector public ID and shared with P0-6 situation counts.
- The Authority map fetches and renders only the selected sector's canonical GeoJSON hazard layers, clearing them immediately on a sector change or unavailable response.

### P0-8B — Authority vessel-hazard associations
- Authority map highlights only vessels whose latest canonical replay position is inside a selected sector's active canonical hazard geometry.

### P0-8C — Authority operational hazard alerts
- Current, stable operational alerts are derived from P0-8B associations and displayed separately from historical broadcast notifications.

### P0-8D — Authority alert inspection
- Selecting a current operational alert reuses the canonical vessel replay focus and highlights the matching canonical hazard and association geometry. Inspection state is local to the active sector and is cleared on sector switch, unavailable data, or alert reconciliation.

### P0-8E — Authority evidence and audit flow
- Alert inspection opens the existing Audit view with direct canonical containment facts, separately labeled sector-situation evidence, and an explicit unavailable trace when no alert-to-run linkage exists.

### P0-8G — Authority route alternatives & balanced candidate
- Extended canonical RouteExposureEngine to return three truthful, evaluated route candidates: Safety-oriented (`ROUTE-A-INSHORE`), Balanced (`ROUTE-C-BALANCED`), and Direct (`ROUTE-B-DIRECT`).
- Route C follows an intermediate path through the canonical synthetic route graph (`node-01` -> `node-03` -> `node-06` -> `node-10` -> `node-14` -> `node-16`), offering a genuine trade-off (23.4 km, 1.7m max wave, 3.4 exposure) between distance and exposure.
- Exposed route alternatives via `/api/v1/demo/routes/alternatives` and `/api/v1/demo/sectors/{sector_id}/route-alternatives`.
- MissionMapBrief and MapView dynamic layer rendering updated with candidate switching, real metric display, and honest empty/unavailable handling without hardcoded operational route geometry.

### P0-8H — Simultaneous route alternatives visualization without clutter
- Established visual hierarchy for route comparison: selected candidate rendered prominently as solid cyan line (`line_width: 4`, `opacity: 0.95`, `#06b6d4`), while non-selected alternatives render simultaneously as thin, dashed lines (`line_width: 2.5`, `line_dasharray: [3, 3]`, `opacity: 0.50`, `#38bdf8`).
- Integrated dynamic sector route fetching in `AuthorityPage` with request cancellation and stale-state clearing on sector switch.
- Stabilized map camera bounds to prevent abrupt jumping/refitting during Safest / Balanced / Direct corridor switching.

### P0-9 — Authoritative Marine Observation Single Source of Truth
- Eliminated architectural source-of-truth split between legacy static `marine_dataset.py` and deterministic synthetic OSF time-series fixture (`data/fixtures/synthetic/incois/osf_hourly_observations.json`).
- Updated `SnapshotConnector` to directly load `osf_hourly_observations.json` and normalize records through `IncoisOSFNormalizer.normalize()`.
- Refactored `DataService` in SNAPSHOT and SYNTHETIC modes to route through `SnapshotConnector`, eliminating hardcoded dummy payloads and silent dataset fallbacks.
- Verified single source-of-truth consistency across fixture -> INCOIS adapter -> ObservationBundle -> Risk Engine -> Situation Assessment -> Researcher Demo API with dedicated test suite (`test_marine_source_of_truth.py`).

### P0-10 — PFZ (Potential Fishing Zone) Data Semantics Fix
- Corrected semantic mapping in Researcher Lab where PFZ thermal gradient (`sst_gradient`) was being converted to a fabricated absolute sea surface temperature (`sst_celsius: 28.0 + p.sst_gradient`) and rendered with `°C`.
- Updated `PFZCandidate` interface, mock fixture, and mapper in `frontend/src/api/researcher-client.ts` to preserve `sst_gradient: number | null` explicitly without fabricating temperature.
- Updated `frontend/src/components/researcher/OceanDataExplorer.tsx` to display `SST Gradient: <value>` without `°C` and preserved `depth_m`, `bearing_deg`, `distance_km`, `chlorophyll_a_mg_m3`, and validity fields.
- Fixed backend `/api/v1/demo/pfz-candidates` fallback `valid_only` filtering to match `qc_status == 'VALID'`.
- Added end-to-end semantic validation tests (`tests/domain/test_pfz_data_semantics.py` and `researcher.test.ts`).

### P0-11 — Removed Fabricated/Random ScenarioLab Fallback Results
- Eliminated all `Math.random()` and mock scenario execution fallbacks in `frontend/src/api/researcher-client.ts`.
- Structured `runScenario` to return genuine results produced by the deterministic `ScenarioRunner` on success, and explicit unavailable/error state (`status: 'error'`, `is_error: true`, `evidence_count: 0`, `trace_steps: 0`, `confidence_level: 'UNKNOWN'`) on network/HTTP failure or timeout.
- Enhanced `ScenarioLab.tsx` with dedicated error cards for unavailable backend scenarios and detailed verdict badges (`PASS`/`FAIL`), executed tools tags, and decisive factors on successful runs.
- Preserved `MOCK_SCENARIOS` strictly for offline scenario list metadata fallback, completely disconnected from execution results.
- Added regression tests verifying zero fake metrics or random calls upon execution failure.

### P0-12 — Persistent DATA MODE Indicator for Researcher Lab
- Added persistent, clearly visible `DATA MODE: SYNTHETIC DEMO / SNAPSHOT` indicator in the shared top-level command bar of `ResearcherPage.tsx`.
- Centralized the source-of-truth constants `CANONICAL_DATA_MODE_LABEL` and `CANONICAL_DATA_MODE_TOOLTIP` in `frontend/src/api/researcher-client.ts`.
- Ensured the indicator persists seamlessly across all 4 Researcher decks (Ocean Data, Data Sources, Scenario Lab, Query Workbench) without layout clipping or tab disruption.
- Verified absence of conflicting/misleading `LIVE` operational labels.

### P0-13 — 48-Hour Marine Observation Time-Series Visualization in Researcher Lab
- Implemented lightweight, pure-SVG 3-panel synchronized temporal visualization in `OceanTimeSeriesChart.tsx` integrated into `OceanDataExplorer.tsx`.
- Exposes temporal behavior across 48 hourly observations for Significant Wave Height (SWH, meters), Sea Surface Temperature (SST, °C), and Wind Speed (knots) with individual calibrated y-scales and caution threshold references.
- Real timestamps rendered on x-axis (e.g. `Sep 11 06:00 UTC`, `Sep 12 18:00 UTC`), strictly sorted chronologically before rendering and latest-card computation.
- Missing/null values are rendered as explicit path gaps (never coerced to zero).
- Full QC awareness distinguishing valid observations (`VALID`) from suspect/flagged ones (`SUSPECT`/`DEGRADED`) visually and in interactive crosshair hover tooltips.
- Latest-condition cards compute values from the newest timestamp rather than arbitrary array order.
- Clear provenance caption: `INCOIS OSF-style hourly observations · 48-hour synthetic snapshot`.
- Harbor selection dynamically loads and renders the 48-hour time series for Ratnagiri vs. Malvan.
- Verified with 18 automated frontend tests in `researcher.test.ts`, full vitest suite (112 tests passing), and clean `tsc && vite build`.

### P0-14 — PFZ (Potential Fishing Zone) Spatial Map Visualization in Researcher Lab
- Implemented `PFZSpatialMap.tsx` reusing existing project MapLibre GL conventions with CartoDB dark matter basemap for spatial exploration of PFZ advisory candidates.
- Plotted genuine candidate coordinates (`latitude`, `longitude`) returned by `GET /api/v1/demo/pfz-candidates?valid_only=true` with rank badges (`#1`, `#2`) and confidence visual indicators.
- Embedded interactive MapLibre popups and bidirectional selection linking between the spatial map and PFZ candidate cards (highlighting and camera focus).
- Preserved strict scientific semantics: explicitly displayed `SST Gradient` (never `SST: X °C`), chlorophyll-a, depth, distance, bearing, validity window, and source.
- Handled backend confidence directly (preserving `HIGH`/`MEDIUM`/`UNKNOWN`, never fabricating or converting missing to 0).
- Handled edge cases: multi-candidate dynamic bounds auto-fitting, single candidate centering, invalid coordinate filtering, and explicit empty state.
- Compact map provenance caption: `INCOIS PFZ-style candidate data · synthetic snapshot`.
- Validated with 7 automated unit & feature transformation tests (119 total frontend tests passing) and clean `tsc && vite build`.

### P0-15 — Hazard Spatial Polygon Visualization in Researcher Lab
- Implemented `HazardSpatialMap.tsx` reusing MapLibre GL conventions and dark basemap styling for spatial exploration of observed/advisory hazard polygons.
- Converted actual backend hazard polygon geometries (`geometry_geojson` Polygon/MultiPolygon) into GeoJSON FeatureCollections, preserving exact polygon vertices.
- Handled coordinate normalizations (numeric pairs and space-separated string pairs `"lon lat"`) with strict validation (filtering out invalid geometries safely without inventing coordinates).
- Established clear visual hierarchy for `ACTIVE` / `PLANNED` vs `EXPIRED` (historical) hazards:
  - ACTIVE/PLANNED hazards render with prominent fill opacity (0.28) and solid outline (width 2.2).
  - EXPIRED historical hazards render with subdued fill opacity (0.08) and dashed outline (`[3, 3]`, width 1.4).
- Preserved categorical severity mapping (`WARNING` #ef4444, `ALERT` #f97316, `WATCH` #f59e0b, `ADVISORY` #38bdf8, `NORMAL` #64748b, missing -> `UNKNOWN` #94a3b8) without calculating fake risk scores or converting missing severity to zero.
- Interactive MapLibre popup with Event Type, Severity, Status badge, Validity window, Affected Area, QC status, Source, and Description.
- Bidirectional interactive selection linking between map polygon features and hazard cards in `OceanDataExplorer.tsx` (card click fits/centers map; map polygon click selects card).
- Preserved overlapping polygons as independent inspectable records without conflation.
- Resilient fallback handling: text-only fallback without geometry renders explicit spatial empty state ("No spatial hazard polygons available for rendering.") without fabricating coordinates.
- Compact provenance caption: `Synthetic hazard polygons · source-faithful demonstration data`.
- Validated with 8 automated unit & feature transformation tests (128 total frontend tests passing), full TypeScript typecheck, and clean `tsc && vite build`.

### P0-16 — Earth Observation 14-Day Temporal Analysis in Researcher Lab
- Resolved temporal truncation by preserving all 350 multi-day satellite grid cell observations (14 daily time slices × 25 spatial cells) in `fetchEOGridCells()`, while preserving `getLatestEOGridCells()` for the latest spatial snapshot table.
- Implemented `EOTemporalAnalysisChart.tsx` featuring pure-SVG 14-day temporal trend line chart with metric switcher:
  - **SST (°C)**: absolute Sea Surface Temperature from INSAT-3D/Oceansat thermal sensors (never confounded with PFZ `sst_gradient`).
  - **Chlorophyll-a (mg/m³)**: surface chlorophyll concentration from Oceansat-3 OCM.
  - **Cloud Cover (%)**: pixel cloud fraction percentage across the 5×5 satellite grid.
- Implemented deterministic daily spatial aggregation (`aggregateEOTemporalSeries`):
  - Strictly groups records by ISO date (`2026-08-30` through `2026-09-12`).
  - Calculates arithmetic daily spatial mean across valid (non-null) grid cells only, without coercing nulls/missing to zero.
  - Generates min-max spatial spread ribbon (shaded variability envelope between daily min and max cell values).
  - Renders null days (e.g. 100% cloud obscuration) as explicit line gaps with 0 valid count.
  - Tracks valid-cell count (e.g. `24 / 25 cells`) and mean pixel uncertainty (e.g. `±0.12`).
- Interactive hover cursor and tooltip with full QC status breakdown (`VALID`, `CLOUD_OBSCURED`, `DEGRADED_QC_WARNING`, `NO_DATA`).
- Summary KPI cards for 14-day overall mean, observed spatial range, and valid cell coverage rate.
- Compact provenance caption: `MOSDAC/EO-style daily observations · 14-day synthetic snapshot · Spatial mean across valid grid cells`.
- Validated with 13 automated unit & feature transformation tests (141 total frontend tests passing), full TypeScript typecheck, and clean `tsc && vite build`.

### P0-17 — Unified Data Quality & Provenance UX in Researcher Lab
- Implemented a lightweight, reusable data quality and provenance presentation layer across all existing synthetic datasets in the Researcher Lab:
  - Created `DataProvenancePanel.tsx`: compact expandable panel with top-bar summary (provider badge, dataset name, synthetic snapshot mode badge, snapshot period, valid-count pill, and drawer toggle) and detailed trust breakdown (source product lineage, QC classification breakdown, pixel uncertainty, semantics disclosure, and documentation link).
  - Created `src/utils/provenance.ts`: deterministic metadata derivation helpers for all 4 analytical datasets:
    - **Marine Weather Observations**: 48-hour hourly snapshot from INCOIS OSF, distinguishing `VALID` vs `SUSPECT` QC records, preserving sensor null gaps without converting to zero.
    - **Earth Observation Satellite Grid**: 14-day 5×5 grid snapshot from ISRO MOSDAC, distinguishing `VALID`, `CLOUD_OBSCURED`, `DEGRADED_QC_WARNING`, and `NO_DATA` states, exposing mean pixel uncertainty when available.
    - **PFZ Advisory Candidates**: INCOIS PFZ candidate front analysis, explicitly separating advisory `confidence` (`HIGH`/`MEDIUM`) from data `qc_status` (`VALID`/`SUSPECT`), and maintaining `SST Gradient` semantics (°C/km or unitless anomaly).
    - **Hazard Advisory Bulletins**: IMD/INCOIS meteorological bulletins, explicitly separating operational validity status (`ACTIVE`/`EXPIRED`/`PLANNED`) from data `qc_status` and event `severity`.
- Updated `DataSourceMonitor.tsx` to display configured prototype source profiles truthfully:
  - Replaced misleading "X ago" live freshness timers with explicit "Configured Sync Cadence" badges (e.g. `1-hour observation cadence`, `6-hour advisory cycle`, `14-day daily raster snapshot`, `Static geofence registry`).
  - Added prototype source registry disclosure card explaining synthetic demo ingestion semantics.
- Preserved authoritative `DATA MODE: SYNTHETIC DEMO / SNAPSHOT` persistent disclosure across all views.
- Validated with comprehensive automated test suite (55 researcher tests, 149 total frontend tests passing across 11 test suites), 31 backend contract/domain tests passing, and clean `npm run build` production bundle.

### P0-18 — Tide Temporal Analysis in Researcher Lab
- Implemented dedicated, lightweight pure-SVG 48-hour tide temporal visualization (`TideTimeSeriesChart.tsx`) integrated into `OceanDataExplorer.tsx` beneath the existing P0-13 3-panel marine chart.
- Preserved existing `OceanTimeSeriesChart.tsx` (3-panel SWH, SST, Wind Speed) completely intact without modification or clutter.
- **Primary Metric**: Tide Level in meters above Chart Datum (`LAT` - Lowest Astronomical Tide), directly sourced from the synthetic INCOIS OSF dataset (`tide_level_m`, `units_json.tide_level`).
- **Secondary Information**: Tide Phase (`tide_phase`), preserved strictly as categorical values (`FLOOD`, `EBB`, `HIGH`, `LOW`). Never coerced to numerical values or inferred from curve slope.
- **Data Quality & Missing Values**:
  - Missing tide levels remain explicit gaps in SVG paths (null ≠ 0).
  - Suspect/degraded QC observations flagged with warning indicators and distinct stroke styling.
  - Zero tide forecasting or fabricated future tide predictions; scientific disclosure explicitly clarifies snapshot boundaries.
- **Tide Provenance & Trust Integration**:
  - Added `deriveTideTrustMetadata` in `src/utils/provenance.ts` integrating the reusable `DataProvenancePanel.tsx`.
  - Exposes provider (INCOIS OSF), 48-hour temporal coverage, valid observation count (e.g. `48 / 48 observations`), QC breakdown, and Chart Datum semantics (`LAT`).
- **Harbor Switching**: Dynamically updates tide observations, SVG curve, phase distribution, and provenance when switching between Ratnagiri and Malvan, with explicit empty/degraded states if unavailable.
- **Validation**: 62 researcher tests (156 total frontend tests passing across 11 suites), 31 backend contract/domain tests passing, and clean `tsc && vite build` bundle.

### P0-19 — Earth Observation Spatial Grid Visualization in Researcher Lab
- Implemented `EOGridSpatialMap.tsx` reusing project MapLibre GL conventions with CartoDB dark matter basemap for spatial exploration of the 5×5 Earth Observation satellite grid across the Konkan coast.
- **14-Date Snapshot Selector**:
  - Dynamically extracts available observation dates (`Aug 30, 2026` → `Sep 12, 2026`) chronologically.
  - Slices only the chosen date's 25 grid cells without contaminating the P0-16 14-day temporal baseline.
  - Features quick step buttons (`<` / `>`) and dropdown picker.
- **Multi-Metric Switcher**:
  - **SST (°C)**: Absolute Sea Surface Temperature from INSAT-3D/Oceansat thermal sensors with calibrated continuous Blue → Amber → Red colormap.
  - **Chlorophyll-a (mg/m³)**: Surface ocean color chlorophyll concentration with Emerald → Green → Cyan colormap.
  - **Cloud Cover (%)**: Pixel cloud fraction percentage with Sky Cyan → Slate → White colormap.
- **Data Quality & QC Semantics**:
  - `VALID` cells render with continuous metric colors.
  - `CLOUD_OBSCURED` cells render with distinct cloud-slate color (`#64748b`) and explicit tooltip status.
  - `DEGRADED_QC_WARNING` / `SUSPECT` cells render with amber warning color (`#f59e0b`).
  - `NO_DATA` / null values render as dark slate (`#334155`) — never converted to zero.
- **Spatial Statistics & Inspection**:
  - 4-card KPI strip displaying Coverage (`X / 25 cells`, cloud-obscured count), Spatial Minimum, Spatial Mean (*strictly across valid cells only*), and Spatial Maximum.
  - Interactive MapLibre hover tooltips and click selection opening an in-depth cell inspector panel (coordinates, pass time, all metrics, uncertainty, and satellite source).
- **Provenance & Trust Integration**:
  - Added `deriveEOSpatialTrustMetadata` in `src/utils/provenance.ts` integrating the reusable `DataProvenancePanel.tsx`.
  - Discloses discrete 5×5 synthetic grid observation semantics without claiming continuous raster or live satellite telemetry.
- **Validation**: 71 researcher tests (165 total frontend tests passing across 11 suites), 31 backend contract/domain tests passing, and clean `tsc && vite build` production bundle.
