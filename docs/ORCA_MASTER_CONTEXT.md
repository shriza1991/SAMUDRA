# ORCA Master Context: Canonical System Specification

> **SIH 2026 Problem Statement:** PS 26176 — ORCA: Marine EcOsystem Reasoning with Collaborative Agents  
> **Theme:** Disaster Management & Maritime Intelligence  
> **Classification:** Authoritative Project Context & Verified System Baseline  
> **Repository Baseline:** SAMUDRA (Smart Autonomous Marine Understanding, Decision & Risk Assistant)

---

## 1. Project Identity

* **Project Name:** ORCA — Marine EcOsystem Reasoning with Collaborative Agents
* **Active Codebase Moniker:** SAMUDRA (`Smart Autonomous Marine Understanding, Decision & Risk Assistant`)
* **Problem Statement:** PS 26176 (SIH 2026) — Sponsored by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) / Department of Space
* **Core Value Proposition:** A mission-intelligence reasoning layer positioned above India's existing fragmented marine information ecosystem (ISRO MOSDAC, INCOIS, IMD, Coast Guard, Fisheries Departments).

---

## 2. Problem Being Solved

India possesses extensive, world-class marine and Earth Observation capabilities:
* **INCOIS:** Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) advisories, Ocean State Forecasts (OSF), High Wave Alerts, and Tsunami early warnings.
* **ISRO MOSDAC:** Oceansat and INSAT satellite feeds, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), and Chlorophyll-a gradient maps.
* **IMD:** Cyclone bulletins, coastal squall advisories, port warning flags, and depression tracks.
* **Maritime Authorities:** Naval firing exercises, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and International Maritime Boundary Lines (IMBL).

**The Core Bottleneck:**
Traditional artisanal fishers, boat skippers, and local port authorities cannot synthesize these disparate, high-latency, format-divergent bulletins in real time. A mariner preparing to leave port must manually cross-reference wave heights, wind vectors, squall advisories, restricted boundaries, and fish concentration forecasts while navigating language barriers and low-connectivity environments.

---

## 3. Product Positioning & What ORCA Is vs. Is Not

### What ORCA IS:
* **Mission Intelligence Layer:** Answers operational questions directly (*"Can I go fishing tomorrow morning from Kochi?"*).
* **Deterministic Risk Gate:** Combines natural language understanding with 100% deterministic, Python-computed geospatial and safety calculations.
* **Multi-Source Reasoning Engine:** Unifies oceanography, meteorology, fisheries science, and maritime regulations into an actionable verdict: `GO`, `CAUTION`, `NO_GO`, or `UNKNOWN`.
* **Multilingual & Voice-Enabled:** Supports voice calls and text in Indian languages (Marathi, Hindi, English, Tamil).
* **Evidence & Provenance Bound:** Every recommendation must explicitly reference authoritative timestamps, URLs, and official agencies.

### What ORCA IS NOT:
* ❌ Not a generic conversational LLM chatbot with hallucinated weather data.
* ❌ Not an autonomous vessel navigation system or autopilot.
* ❌ Not a certified SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) life-safety system.
* ❌ Not a pure multi-agent theoretical sandbox; it enforces rigid runtime safety bounds.
* ❌ Not an LLM that calculates wave heights or distances internally.

## 4. User Taxonomy

### Primary User (70% Prototype Focus)
* **Coastal Fisherman / Vessel Skipper / Boat Operator:**
  * Needs immediate, high-stakes voyage clarity: *"Can I leave at 6 AM?", "Where are the fish?", "Which route is safe?"*
  * Requires vernacular speech/audio interaction (hands-free on rough waters) and high-contrast, simple visual cues.
  * Operates three vessel profiles:
    1. `traditional_non_motorized` (strictest thresholds: wave ceiling 1.5m, wind 18 kn).
    2. `motorized_boat` (wave ceiling 2.5m, wind 25 kn).
    3. `mechanized_trawler` (wave ceiling 3.5m, wind 35 kn).

### Secondary User (30% Focus)
* **Fisheries Department / Disaster Management Authority / Harbor Master:**
  * Audits zone alerts, monitors active squall/cyclone polygons along coastal sectors, cross-references fleet advisory compliance, and tracks data freshness.

### PLANNED / FUTURE Target Architecture

## 8. Inviolable Safety & Decision Principles

1. **Deterministic Authority:** The LLM NEVER calculates numerical thresholds, wave risks, or geodesic distances. All safety decisions originate strictly in Python code (`DeterministicRiskEngine`).
2. **The 5 Hard-Stops:**
   * Active IMD Cyclone Warning or Red Alert within 50 nm triggers unconditional `NO_GO`.
   * Prohibited maritime boundary breach triggers unconditional `NO_GO`.
   * Stale telemetry (>24h) or missing critical data can NEVER produce a `GO` status (must return `UNKNOWN` or `CAUTION`).
   * LLM Non-Contradiction Gate: The response composer cannot soften or overturn a deterministic `NO_GO`.
   * Hallucination Gate: Uncited numerical marine claims are stripped from model output.
3. **Derived Confidence:** Confidence (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`) is derived deterministically from source freshness and official authority, not generated by an LLM guessing percentages.
