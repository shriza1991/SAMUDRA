# ORCA Decisions

Only cross-cutting decisions go here.

## D001 — Modular Monolith
Status: ACCEPTED

Keep the initial product as a modular monolith with bounded internal contexts.

Reason: Faster parallel development and simpler deployment.

## D002 — Deterministic Safety Authority
Status: ACCEPTED

Deterministic domain code owns safety states, constraints, geometry, and threshold calculations.

Reason: Safety-critical calculations must be reproducible and auditable.

## D003 — Evidence-First Provenance
Status: ACCEPTED

Recommendations retain source, time, validity, quality, and authority metadata.

## D004 — Contract-First Parallel Development
Status: ACCEPTED

Shared interfaces are changed before dependent consumers.

## D005 — LIVE / HYBRID / SNAPSHOT
Status: ACCEPTED

All external data paths explicitly declare operating mode.

## D006 — Develop as Integration Branch
Status: ACCEPTED

Members work on team/* branches, merge continuously to develop, then promote verified releases to main.

## D007 — Mission Twin as Core Differentiator
Status: ACCEPTED

Mission-level reasoning, counterfactual simulation, and alternatives are core product capabilities.

## D008 — Ecosystem-First Positioning
Status: ACCEPTED

ORCA consumes and orchestrates existing authoritative services instead of claiming to replace them.

## D009 — Pilot Before National Scale
Status: ACCEPTED

Prove one geography deeply before broadening coverage.

## D010 — Official-Source Precedence Hierarchy
Status: ACCEPTED

Decision:
IMD is the supreme authority for severe weather and cyclone alerts. INCOIS is the primary authority for ocean state forecasts and PFZ advisories. Secondary models (Open-Meteo) act strictly as unauthoritative fallback.

Reason:
Maritime safety requires deterministic, legally defensible, and conservative decisions. Under conflicting telemetry, the system always adopts the conservative hazard state.

Impact:
Connectors and risk engine always prioritize official bulletins over secondary models.

## D011 — Provider Status Taxonomy
Status: ACCEPTED

Decision:
Classify every data source under exactly one status: `LIVE`, `LIMITED`, `CACHED_REAL`, `HISTORICAL`, or `MOCK`. Never mark a source as `LIVE` without verified machine-readable execution at runtime.

Reason:
Prevents AI agents and developers from conflating declared endpoints with verified live access.

## D012 — Snapshot Fallback and Provenance Tagging Policy
Status: ACCEPTED

Decision:
In `HYBRID` mode, when a live provider request times out (>3.5s) or fails, the connector falls back to pre-seeded authoritative snapshots, explicitly flags `[SNAPSHOT-FALLBACK]` in warnings, and downgrades derived confidence.

Reason:
Ensures zero-crash resilience during operational connectivity drops while maintaining strict transparency.

## D013 — Pilot Geography Scope (Maharashtra / Konkan Coast)
Status: ACCEPTED

Decision:
Anchor the P0 MVP implementation around Ratnagiri, Malvan, and the Konkan marine corridor (covering active INCOIS PFZ sectors, Malvan Marine Sanctuary, and Goa naval firing sectors).

Reason:
Allows deep, end-to-end multi-source validation across real coastal landing centres before scaling nationally.
