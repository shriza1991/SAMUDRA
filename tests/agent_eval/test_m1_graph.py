"""Milestone M1 Executable Graph Tests for SAMUDRA / ORCA.

Validates the first end-to-end vertical slice of the Bounded Agent Graph:
1. PFZ vertical slice flow (Where is the nearest PFZ?)
2. SAFETY vertical slice flow (Is it safe to go fishing tomorrow?)
3. CONDITIONS vertical slice flow (What are the wave conditions?)
4. UNSUPPORTED query flow (Tell me a joke / non-marine queries)
5. Tool registry integration and telemetry logging
6. Evidence validation coverage gate
7. Deterministic safety status invariance
8. Sanitized execution trace generation (no private CoT)
9. Graph termination guarantee
